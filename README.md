# Weekend Redux Feedback Loop

## Description


The Weekend Redux Feedback Loop is an application that is able to gather feedback submitted by a user. It asks three specific questions and gives the user an ability to leave a comment as well. 

I utilized react to make the site be able to flow through the feedback options on the click of a button. The data is able to be secured and retained through routes that were put in place as well. 


### Prerequisites


Node.js
Axios
React
Redux
Postgresql

## Installation

1. Create a database named `prime_feedback`,
2. The queries in the `database.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!
